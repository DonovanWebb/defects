Topological defects in Liquid Crystals

what are they:
- points in ridge structure where it breaks down
- place where continuous order breaks down
e.g. point defects
- cant remove under topological deformations
- magnets and crystals can have these
- but will focus on liquid crystals (LC)

- LC - made of rod-like molecules
- all align as this is energetically favoured
- get large order structure "nematic order"

why important:
- they act like particles
- as topologically protected they cant be removed
(But why do the substrate only deform smoothly? Cant the rods flip randomly?)
- they have 'charge': + attracts -, + repels +
- they are big! - big atoms
- Torons
(can we describe all particles as point defects)
- colloids plus defects
    - making knots! Ravnik/Musevic Labs
